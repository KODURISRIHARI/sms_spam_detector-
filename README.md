Excited to share my latest project: "Is SMS Spam or Not?" 📱✨
In this project, I utilized the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify SMS messages as spam or not. For deployment, I leveraged Streamlit to create an interactive user interface.
To prepare the data, I implemented text preprocessing techniques, including:
Removing non-alphabetic characters
Converting text to lowercase
Tokenizing and stemming using the Snowball Stemmer
Eliminating stopwords
After preprocessing, I transformed the cleaned text into numerical features using CountVectorizer.
To evaluate the model's performance, I implemented a confusion matrix and generated a comprehensive classification report, including metrics such as F1 score, recall, precision, and accuracy.
